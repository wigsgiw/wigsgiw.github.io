      <p>
        Not one to be defined by genre or tempo restraints, Sam Binga is a relatively new name in bass music circles. With releases on pioneering labels Exit records, 50 Weapons, Critical Music and more, and tracks in heavy rotation by DJ’s worldwide such as dBridge, Om Unit, Alix Perez, Kode 9 and Mark Pritchard to name a few.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having released music previously under the moniker 'Baobinga', he is definitely no stranger to the art of electronic music production and DJing having spent many a year honing his art.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are absolutely stoked to be presenting Sam on his first visit to NZ under his new pseudonym
        and we’re confident this will be a not to be missed event paving the way for the future of bass music.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a heavy hitting local support lineup featuring Lowquid (Serato guru), and Pimms and Fakawi of 36Deep there will be exclusives and bangers a plenty.
      </p>
